# Getting Started

For administrative & HR-related information and practicalities, the [UU Intranet](intranet.uu.nl) is your starting point! There is a whole widget on _New at the UU?_ with relevant links, starting with _Information for New Employees_.  

The library has its own corner in the corporate environment: [UBU Intranet](https://intranet.uu.nl/universiteitsbibliotheek)

## Practical Things

Here's a summary of things you can cover in your first days:

**Arrange Hardware & Software**

- [ ] Laptop
- [ ] Phone
- [ ] Two-Factor Authentication](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/2fa)
- [ ] [VPN](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/mobile-working-solis-vpn)
- [ ] [IT manuals](https://manuals.uu.nl/nl/a-z/)

**Staff Access**

- [ ] UBU Employee Card
- [ ] [UU Campus Card](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/campus-card)

**Administration & HR**

- [ ] Check out [Self-Service HR](https://mijn.uu.nl). 
- [ ] Fill in your work schedule on Self-Service HR
- [ ] Update your [personal profile page](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/about-the-profile-pages)
- [ ] Check out [TopDesk](http://uu.topdesk.net/) - a self-service portal.

## New Staff Orientation Session

New staff members are always invited to an [orientation session](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/orientation-sessions-for-new-employees). These sessions take place 5 times a year. You'll receive an invitation via email about 4-6 weeks prior to the next meeting. 

## Campus Map

In case you need to find your way to different buildings and locations, here's a [link](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/campus/maps) to maps of the campus.

# University Library

AKA. The nicest building(s) on campus.

## Strategic Plan 2022-2025

You can read the UB's [Strategic Plan for 2022-2025](https://intranet.uu.nl/system/files/UU%20UB%20Policy%20Plan%202022-2025%20-%204MB.pdf) here. We are still working on the year plan for 2023.

## The UB: Offline

The UB is situated in two locations: the City Centre (UBB) & Utrecht Science Part (USP). 

You'll mostly work at the USP, at the offices on the 2nd floor. FYI: Rooms 2.14 & 2.16 are the ones where staff from Academic Services/Team RDM usually work, though there will likely be a new (flexible) office plan in the coming months.

Team RDM works partly from home, and partly from the office. We prefer to do our meetings in person and your choice of location for independent work is largely flexible.

## The UB: Online

Our online activities are organized through MS Teams. We have an UB-wide _koffiehoek_ and the Academic Services Teams. We'll add you to these Teams.

## UB-wide Meetings

- I(dee) D(elen) koffie (weekly)
- I&D Bijeenkomst (quarterly)

You'll be invited to these meetings by the organizers. These are meetings where UB colleagues across sectors come together to share updates and ideas. They are not manadatory, but they're nice to attend when you have time and you learn about what's happening in other parts of the library.

## Informal Meetings

There are a lot of initiatives you could join to meet colleagues: There are WhatsApp groups for UB colleagues who like to take walks around USP during lunchtime and or meet for lunch on the 2nd floor. Moreover, Academic Services is also organizing _ontmoetingslunches_. You can talk to Dafne or Neha if you want to know more.

# Academic Services

This is our sector! <3 

## The Bosses

The managers of our sector include:

- **Division Manager**: Martine Pronk
- **Department Manager**: Kim Bergmans 
- **Department Manager**: Sven Raeymaekers 
- **Department Manager**: Wenneke Meerstadt 

Kim is our direct manager, so you'll be meeting with her regularly. 

## Faculty Liasions

To learn about the UB's services and relations with respect to the UU faculties, it is good to have meetings with faculty liaisons. Faculty liaisons are the first points of contact and representatives of the library at the faculties. They are considered to be the ones with in-depth knowledge about ‘who is who’ at the faculty-level. Therefore, make an appointment with: 

- [ ] **Science**: [Aleksandre Gogaladze](https://www.uu.nl/staff/AGogaladze) -> Aleks will be leaving us soon, so maybe meet with [Andreas Franzke](https://www.uu.nl/staff/AWFranzke) (information specialist).
- [ ] **Veterinary Sciences**: [Felix Weijdema](https://www.uu.nl/staff/FPWeijdema)
- [ ] **Humanities**: [Rogier Schumacher](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RWGSchumacher)
- [ ] **Medical Sciences**: [Najoua Ryane](n.ryane@uu.nl)
- [ ] **Geosciences**: [Jeroen Bosman](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JMBosman)
- [ ] **Law, Economics, and Government**: [Sandrien Banens](https://www.uu.nl/staff/SHBanens)
- [ ] **Social Sciences**: [Jan de Boer](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JdeBoer) -> Jan is on sick leave for now, so maybe meet with [Erika Manten](https://www.uu.nl/staff/EIBManten) (information specialist)

## AS Teams

Academic Services is further organized into teams. For management purposes, these teams are divided between Kim, Sven and Wenneke. Each team has a contact person (or _aanspreekpunt_). It would be helpful to meet these contact persons and learn about what each team does and how we all fit together within the sector:

- [ ] **OPERA**: [Felix Weijdema](https://www.uu.nl/staff/FPWeijdema)
- [ ] **Coding & Software**: [Neha Moopen](n.moopen@uu.nl)
- [ ] **Digital Humanities Support**: [Arja Firet](https://www.uu.nl/staff/AKFiret)
- [ ] **Special Collections**: [Marco van Egmond](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MvanEgmond1) -> try to visit Marco at Special Colellections in-person, there's lots of cool maps and more! 
- [ ] **Learning**: [Marie-Louise Goudeau](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MSGoudeau)
- [ ] **ADD**: [Desiree ten Dam](https://www.uu.nl/staff/DCMtenDam) & [Rogier Schumacher](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RWGSchumacher)
- [ ] **RDM Support**: [Dafne Jansen](d.jansen@uu.nl)
- [ ] **Publishing Support**: [Jan de Boer](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JdeBoer) -> we need to track down someone else in Team Publishing for you to talk to, while Jan is away.
- [ ] **Copyright Information Office**: [Saskia Manuela Bergmans](https://www.uu.nl/staff/SAManuelaBergmans) & [Judith Hanekuijk](j.hanekuijk@uu.nl)
- [ ] **BONUS -> Open Access Specialist:** [Jeroen Sondervan](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/jsondervan)

## AS Meetings

Currently, Academic Services gets together (via MS Teams) for a meeting every week or so. They are not mandatory, but we recommend to attend them regularly. During these meetings, there is usually one presentation which serves as an update of what a particular person/team has been up to. 

# RDM Support 

This is your team! We are so happy to have you join us!

## Overview

**RDM Website**

Take some time to go through the RDM Support [website](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management). It's our go-to page for both researchers and staff. While you're at it, let us know if you have any feedback on improving the website! 

**Newsletter**

RDM Support also has a [newsletter](https://mailings.uu.nl/hp/gKQRpokhPxN6bw8NlPTr8g/subscribe_newsletter_research_data_management_support) that you can subscribe to.

**RDM Policy @UU**

You can read the [University Framework for Research Data UU](https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/university_policy_framework_for_research_data_utrecht_university_-_january_2016.pdf). Faculties have their specific policies as well, but this overarching one is a start.

**FAIR Research IT Program**

A particularly interesting program at the UU, is the FAIR Research IT Program. The previous "'edition' of this program led to the formation of RDM Support and the UDMC amongst other things. Read all about it on the [UU website](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/information-and-technology-services-its/what-we-do/research-and-it) and the [program website](https://itforresearch.uu.nl/wiki/FAIR_Research_IT_programma_aan_de_UU#).

## RDM Within UB

**Data Consultants**

- [ ] [Dafne Jansen](d.jansen@uu.nl) (also functions as a Community Manager)
- [ ] [Jacques Flores](j.p.flores@uu.nl)
- [ ] [Mary Felix-Maina](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MWFelixMaina) -> Mary is currently on maternity leave.

**Data Managers** 

- [ ] [Ron Scholten](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RHHScholten)
- [ ] [Dorien Huijser](https://www.uu.nl/staff/DCHuijser)

## Communications

We have two communication advisors that support us: [Petra Davids](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PMDavids) and [Marloes Beerling](m.beerling@uu.nl). 

## RDM Beyond The UB

### ITS

RDM Support is a collaboration between the UB & [Information Technology Services (ITS)](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/information-and-technology-services-its). 

Within ITS, there are three teams we interact with regularly:
- [Research Engineering](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/research-engineering/)
- DevOps 
- The team that doesn't have a name yet, but deals with most research services (like PURE, MyPhD, Qualtrics). 

**The Boss & Coordinators**

The department manager for the aforementioned ITS teams is [Frank Heere](https://www.uu.nl/staff/FHHeere). 

The team coordinators are as follows:

- [ ] Research Engineering: [Martine de Vos](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MGdeVos) 
- [ ] DevOps: [Rob van Schip](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RJAvanSchip)
- [ ] No-Name Team: [Arjan Sieverink](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JASieverink)

Do make sure to meet Martine de Vos, you will likely meet the others during a D-Lunch or another meeting/event.

Our colleagues from Research Engineering co-work in the Administrative Building (Bestuursgebouw) on Mondays and Thursdays in Room 3.40, you are also welcome to join them there!
	
### Faculties	
	
The RDM Support 'network' goes well beyond the UB and ITS. We will tell you more about the network and the idea of central vs. faculty-level RDM Support during your first weeks, as well as during the Intro to RDM @UU training day.

As a start, you can plan meetings with the following people:

**Faculty Data Managers/Stewards**

- [ ] **Data Manager @Humanities & REBO**: [Frans de Liagre-Bohl](https://www.uu.nl/staff/FMTdeLiagreBohl)
- [ ] **Data Manager @Geosciences**: [Vincent Brunst](https://www.uu.nl/staff/VBrunst)
- [ ] **TechSupport @Social Sciences**: [Dennis Hofman](https://www.uu.nl/staff/DHofman) (he is a very busy guy, so don't be worried if he's doesn't answer his e-mail)
- [ ] **Data Stewards @Science**: [Frans Huigen](https://www.uu.nl/staff/FHuigen) & [Mercedes Beltran](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MIBeltran)

**Privacy & Information Security**

- [ ] **Privacy @UB & @Veterinary Sciences**: [Pieter-Bas de Lange](p.s.j.delange@uu.nl) & [Kasper de Bruijn](k.debruijn@uu.nl)
- [ ] **Information Security @UB & Veterinary Sciences**: [Saskia van den Hout](s.e.vandenhout@uu.nl)

The Privacy Officers at other faculties are listed below, but you don't need to plan a meeting with them. You'll see them other meetings/events, make sure to say hi when you do!

- **REBO & Humanities:** Joris de Graaf
- **Social Sciences:** Jacqueline Tenkink
- **Geosciences:** Francisco Romero Pastrana

## RDM Meetings 

Meetings for RDM Support occur at different levels:

- **DMDC meeting:** Monthly meetings for the Data Consultants & Data Managers at UB, as well as the KimBoss.

- **RDM Askathon:** A wholly informal and non-mandatory meeting of RDM colleagues within the library to ask each other RDM questions and learn from one another. -> Mary would organize these, but it hasn't occured since she left for maternity leave.

- **D-Lunch:** A twice-monthly informal meeting with people from the broader RDM support network. The focus of this group used to be the collaboration between the UB and ITS, but we now have colleagues from the faculties joining as well. Not a mandatory meeting, but definitely recommended.

- **RDM Expert Meeting:** A semi-formal meeting with people from the larger RDM Support network to dive into + discuss RDM-specific topics and issues. The focus of this group is aligning key players like central RDM Support, faculty-level support, privacy & information security.

- **Utrecht Data Management Community (UDMC) Meeting:** A bimonthly semi-formal meeting with people from the regional network. The focus of this group is collaboration between UU and UMCU, but also other Utrecht Science Park organizations. 

## MS Teams

We will add you to the 2x MS Teams groups for RDM Support: 

- RDM Support 
- Utrecht Data Management Community

# Open Science & FAIR @UU

Open Science has been a strategic goal of the UU for a couple of years now. 
You can read all about the UU's ambitions with respect to Open Science on the [UU website](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science). 

## Open Science Platform

The Open Science Program at UU is directed by the [Open Science Platform](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/about-us/utrecht-university-open-science-platform).

## Tracks

The Open Science Program is centered around the following tracks:

- [ ] [Open Access](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/open-access)
- [ ] [FAIR Data & Software](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/fair-data-and-software)
- [ ] [Public Engagement](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/public-engagement)
- [ ] [Recognition & Rewards](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/recognition-and-rewards)

The FAIR Data & Software track is particularly relevant for us at RDM Support. Jacques is currently our representative in this working group.

## Open Science Fellows



## Faculty Open Science Teams 

With Open Science being an important part of the UU's Strategic Plan, every Faculty has an Open Science Team now. They are composed of at least one Open Science fellow from each of the aforementioned tracks, in addition to the OSCU Ambassadors and faculty management. You can learn more about the FOSTs on the [UU website](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/faculty-open-science-team-the-next-step-in-the-realization-of-open-science).

## Open Science Community Utrecht

Not specifically RDM-focused, but a very important bottom up initiative to keep up with researchers! > This group used to be very active, but is a bit quiet at the moment...

You can register on their [website](https://openscience-utrecht.com/). OSCU also has a Slack group that you can join!

They usually organize an _OSCoffee_ every month and there are larger faculty-specific open science symposiums organized through the year.

There is an 'OSCU Ambassador' at every faculty, you might see these researchers around - they're (obviously) more active than others in the field!
